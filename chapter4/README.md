In this chapter, service deman and evaluation are explored! 

### Service Demand
Route 52 only runs during the periods of A.M. peak, midday and P.M. peak. Based on this we decided to allocate 34% to the A.M. peak, 32% to the midday period and the last 34% to the P.M. peak. In the data folder, the distribution of boardings at each stop along the route associated with each time period are detailed. From these results, load profile graphs can be generated. This is where the images of the figures should be displayed, however, it was unable to knit.

### Service Evaluation
Use the data file labelled "Load Profile Analysis" to begin analyzing the how frequency changes throughout the time periods in a day. In order to evaluate the service utilization, the current frequency and the optimal frequency in each direction must be compared. Based on the steps, the results should be as follows.

For the AM/PM peaks, the current frequency is higher than optimal and therefore the allocated service is over-utilized. Ideally the frequency should be decreased to the minimum of 1 bus per hour to save costs and avoid running empty buses. For the mid-day time period the frequency was 0 as no buses were running at the time however by analyzing the data from task 4 and 5 we can see that the frequency can be brought up to the minimum of 1 bus per hour to accommodate the demand for mid-day service.
